## Simple Machine Learning Model in Python 

We present in this repository, a simple Machine Learning Model implemented in Python, we will train a Linear Regression Model and expect to perfom correct on a fresh input. 

## Sample Training Set

As described below, we have X as input and Y as output:

| **X1** | **X2** | **X3** | **Y** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | **14** |
| 4 | 5 | 6 | **32** |
| 10 | 10 | 10 | **60** |

Given the training set you could easily guess that the output Y is **X1 + 2 * X2 + 3 * X3**.
